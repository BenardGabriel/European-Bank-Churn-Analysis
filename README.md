# European-Bank-Churn-Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project aims to perform a comprehensive churn analysis for a European bank using customer data across France, Germany, and Spain. The goal is to explore customer behavior, identify patterns that contribute to customer churn, and generate actionable insights that can help improve retention strategies.

I plan to analyze a dataset of 10,000 bank customers, focusing on demographic factors (age, gender, country), financial indicators (account balance, estimated salary), and account behaviors (credit card ownership, active status). The final output will include visual dashboards that break down churn distribution across key segments.

## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s competitive banking landscape, customer retention is a critical factor in sustaining profitability and growth. European banks face increasing challenges due to customer churn, which can lead to substantial revenue loss and decreased customer lifetime value.

This project is focused on analyzing customer data from a European bank to uncover the factors contributing to churn. By understanding demographic and behavioral patterns, the bank can implement targeted strategies to improve customer loyalty and retention.
